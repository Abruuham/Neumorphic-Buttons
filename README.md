# Soft Neumorphic Button styles using SwiftUI

This project was written using SwiftUI in order to create an animation of a soft neumorphic styly button. This project was created by adapting some of the code from [Hacking with Swift] and the inspiration came from [Voicu Apostol].


The button can be made into either Light Mode or Dark mode by changing the colors from lightStart-> darkStart and lightEnd-> darkEnd.
